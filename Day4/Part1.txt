Space needs to be cleared before the last supplies can be unloaded from the ships, 
and so several Elves have been assigned the job of cleaning up sections of the camp.
Every section has a unique ID number, and each Elf is assigned a range of section
IDs.

However, as some of the Elves compare their section assignments with each other, 
they've noticed that many of the assignments overlap. To try to quickly find 
overlaps and reduce duplicated effort, the Elves pair up and make a big list of the 
section assignments for each pair (your puzzle input).

In how many assignment pairs does one range fully contain the other?
