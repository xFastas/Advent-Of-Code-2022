As you watch the crane operator expertly rearrange the crates, 
you notice the process isn't following your prediction.

Some mud was covering the writing on the side of the crane, and you
 quickly wipe it away. The crane isn't a CrateMover 9000 - it's a CrateMover 9001.

The CrateMover 9001 is notable for many new and exciting features: air conditioning, 
leather seats, an extra cup holder, and the ability to pick up and move multiple crates 
at once.

Before the rearrangement process finishes, update your simulation so that the Elves know where 
they should stand to be ready to unload the final supplies. After the rearrangement procedure 
completes, what crate ends up on top of each stack?
