By the time you calculate the answer to the Elves' question, they've already 
realized that the Elf carrying the most Calories of food might eventually run out of snacks.

To avoid this unacceptable situation, the Elves would instead like to know the total Calories 
carried by the top three Elves carrying the most Calories. That way, even if one of those Elves 
runs out of snacks, they still have two backups.


Find the top three Elves carrying the most Calories. How many Calories are those Elves carrying in total?
